# `rithm`

A Python toolkit for mastering and exploring essential algorithms with clarity and efficiency.

---

## üìö Description

`rithm` is crafted to be an insightful toolkit for navigating and mastering algorithmic challenges. Just as a rithm guides the sequence and progression of movement, this library provides clear, optimized implementations of essential algorithms, enabling developers to discover elegant solutions and build efficient, high-performance systems with confidence.

"Rhythm" is famously one of the hardest words to spell in English. By removing the "y" and the first "h," "rithm" becomes a simpler, more direct representation of the concept. This mirrors the goal of algorithms: to simplify complex problems into clear, executable steps.
