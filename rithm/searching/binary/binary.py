"""
This module implements a binary search algorithm.

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list
of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval,
narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

e.g. 1billion elements in simple search would take 1 billion comparisons,
while in binary search it would take only about 30 comparisons. (log2(1 billion) â‰ˆ 30)

log2(32) = 5 # because 2^5 = 32
